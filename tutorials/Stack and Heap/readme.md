# Stack and Heap

this are some notes about differences between the stack and the heap.
That arose from a question, asked in another course, that sounded like "why not to use the stack since it is faster than the heap?".

This matter is a hook for several significant topics, so I've put together this slides and some associated code snippets:

1. ```stacklimit.c ``` -> shows how to smash against the stack
2. ```stacklimit_setlimit.c``` -> shows how to modifiy the stack limit <
3. ```stack_use.c``` -> show some more interesting stuff about the relation of stack and heap
